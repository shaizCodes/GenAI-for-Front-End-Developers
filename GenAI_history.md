# Quick Notes

- Artificial Intelligence like a toddler in mid 20th century
- Machine Learning maturing in 80s and 90s
- Deep Learning in early 2000s changed the landscape. It uses multiple layers of neural networks to understand and represnt data at different layers. This break through gave us GenAI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and Google's Gemini 1.5.
- GenAI does not only mimic but also generates coherent and meaningful data.

- Key Modalites:
  - Text Generation
  - Image Generation
  - Code Generation
  - Data Synthesis

- Practical Applications:
  - UI/UX Design
  - Automated Testing
  - Content Personalization

- It is essential to consider the ethical implications of using GenAI. Issues in Data Privacy, Bias in AI models and Potential Misuses must be addressed. **Developers should strive to use GenAI responsibly, ensuring transparency, and fairness**.
