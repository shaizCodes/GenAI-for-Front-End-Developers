#### Open Ended Questions

1. How would you enhance the AI-generated design to align with your unique creative vision?

    **A**: I would give small and simple intructions to GenAI to fix minor things for me. I prefer using Google Stitch and I copy the designs to Figma where I can modify those according to my taste.

2. What additional features might improve the user experience of the music streaming app?

    **A**: AI integrated voice and image searches can enhance user experience by making it easy to find songs by recording background music or scanning album covers or lyrics.
