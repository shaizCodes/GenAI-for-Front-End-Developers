## Exercices

### Design Challenge

**Scenario**: You are a designing a new music streaming app. The home screen should feature trending songs, personalized playlists, and a search bar.

**Task**:

* [x] Generate an initial home screen design for the music streaming app.
[View the home screen.](./designs/music-streaming-app/README.md#initial-design)
* [x] Create at least 2 variations of the design.
* [x] Tailor one of the designs for a different theme (e.g., podcast-focused).

**Open Ended Questions**:

1. How would you enhance the AI-generated design to align with your unique creative vision?

    **A**: I would give small and simple intructions to GenAI to fix minor things for me. I prefer using Google Stitch and I copy the designs to Figma where I can modify those according to my taste.

2. What additional features might improve the user experience of the music streaming app?

    **A**: AI integrated voice and image searches can enhance user experience by making it easy to find songs by recording background music or scanning album covers or lyrics.

### Coding Challenge

**Scenario**: You are adding a feature to a web app that displays a modal window when a button is clicked. The modal should close when the user clicks outside of it or presses the "Esc" key.

**Task**:

* [x] Generate a function to open and close the modal window.
* [x] Implement the functionality to close the modal when clicking outside of it or pressing the "Esc" key.
* [x] Integrate the generated code into your existing project and test it.

**Open Ended Questions**:

1. How would you enhance the AI-generated code to better fit your project requirements?

    **A**: I would review the code, understand its logic, and write brief meaningful comments around the code snippet.

2. What additional features might improve the user experience of the modal window?

    **A**: Some additional features that could improve the user experience of the modal window include:
    * Allowing the modal to be draggable or resizable.
    * Making the modal accessible by supporting keyboard navigation and screen readers.
    * Providing customizable buttons (e.g., "Cancel", "Confirm") and supporting callback functions.
    * Adding smooth open/close animations for better visual feedback.
    * Preventing background scrolling when the modal is open.
    * Supporting focus trapping to keep keyboard focus within the modal.
    * Offering responsive design so the modal works well on all devices.
